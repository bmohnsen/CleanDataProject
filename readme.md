Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used for this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

In this project, you find:


run_analysis.R : the R-code run on the data set

1. Read and combine training and test sets to create one data set with column names.

2. Extract mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Use descriptive names for activities

4. Label data set with descriptive names

5. Create a second tidy set 


Tidy.txt : the clean data extracted file (with space delimited) from the original data using run_analysis.R 


CodeBook.md : the CodeBook reference to the variables in Tidy.txt 


README.md : the analysis of the code in run_analysis.R  


Data set (Human Activity Recognition Using Smart Phones): https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


Description of Data set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Steps:

1. Download and unzip file.

2. Move data folder to same working directory as run_anlaysis.R

3. Execute run_analysis.R
